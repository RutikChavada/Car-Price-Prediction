# Car-Price-Prediction
This project is a machine learning-based web app that predicts the price of a car based on user input such as brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. It uses a regression model built with scikit-learn, served via a Flask API, and features a clean, interactive React frontend for real-time predictions.
